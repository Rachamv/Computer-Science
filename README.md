Time: 52 hours

### Course Description
Explore the basic concepts, nomenclature, and historical perspective of computers and computing, and principles of software development and Object-Oriented Programming.

#### Course Introduction
This course will introduce you to the field of computer science and the fundamentals of computer programming. CS101 is specifically designed for students with no prior programming experience, and touches upon a variety of fundamental topics. This course uses Java to demonstrate those topics. Java is a high-level, portable, and well-constructed computer programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle).
By the end of the course, you will understand the basics of computer science and the Java programming language. The principles you learn here will be developed further as you progress through the computer science discipline.

This course includes the following units:

- Unit 1: Introduction 11 hours
- Unit 2: Object-Oriented Programming 3 hours
- Unit 3: Java in Practice 9 hours
- Unit 4: Relational and Logical Operators in Java 5 hours
- Unit 5: Control Structures 10 hours
- Unit 6: User-Defined Methods 4 hours
